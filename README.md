# beatdrop
A streamlined way for music producers to organize their beats and collaborate.

# The System
An easy website to organize your beats!

## Goal:
An easy way to store projects and organize them in terms of genre, bpm, other categories that user makes up.

## The Problem:
Beats get lost and you don't know that you've created them. Oftentimes it's hard to rediscover projects and organize them once you have hundreds of beats.

## The Solution:
By being able to add labels and categorize your projects, you'll be able to easily organize what you've finished, what you still need to work on, and the genres of music you've created.

#Add-on Stem Share
## What do Producers want?
Producers want an easy way to collaborate with others even if they don't share the same DAW. As of right now, music producers are discouraged from cross-platform collaboration.

## What do Producers use currently?
Most producers use Google Drive or some other form of cloud storage system to share their stems, midi files, and sounds. 

## The problem: 
Throguh platforms like drive or other cloud storage systems, they aren't built directly for music production, so a lot of information/features are left out. Some simple information like the name and bpm of project is left to the producer to properly name. 

## The Solution:
Stemshare is cloud database specifically built for music producers to make music collaboration easier.
